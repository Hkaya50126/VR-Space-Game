# VR-Space-Game
 
In this game, I integrated VR controllers into the gameplay, implemented character hand swapping, enabled objects to interact with the physical environment, allowed teleportation based on controller direction, implemented opening and closing doors with a button, shooting with a weapon, created targets affected by random forces, ensured automatic deletion of bullets that miss the target, and included climbing mechanics, among many other features.
